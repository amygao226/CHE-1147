# 🫎 CHE1147: Chemical Data Science and Engineering 
**Fall 2025 · University of Toronto**

Our course combines {Data + Chemistry + Engineering}. We’ll explore how **machine learning and data science** can solve real chemical engineering problems with a mix of:
- Lectures with chemical examples and datasets 📊
- Hands-on sessions 👩‍💻
- Group projects 💡

This repo is where lectures, tutorials, assignments, and project guidelines will live for our course. 

This course is the foundation for CHE1148.
